Logic Design with HDL Assignment.
FIFO - First In First Out is one of the most popular logic circuits in digital systems. It works as a
buffer memory, where the data which is written to first will be the data read out first as Figure 1. The
implement logic is often based on ring buffer principle.
Let’s study ring buffer, FIFO theory and it’s applications. Then design and implement a FIFO circuit
using Verilog HDL. Write test benches to verify the implemented circuit.
